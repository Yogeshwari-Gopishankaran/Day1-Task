Objects:
     => It is a important data type which is important to building bloacks of JavaScripts.
     => Objects are different from primitive data types(Numer,String,Boolean,null,undefined,NAN)
     => Ojects can contain any combination of primitive data types.
     => It is in the form of "Key:Value" pair.
     => Every object has some property associated with some Value.The values can be accessed using the properties associated with them.

     Syntax:
             const object_name={
                key1: "value1";
                key2: "value2"; 
             }
                      

           Example:
                    const person={
                        name:'arav',
                        age: 20,
                        class: 10
                        }  
                        
                    console.log(person);   // print the whole objects
                    console.log('Name : '+person.name);    //print the name 
                    console.log('Age :  '+person.age);     //print the age
                    console.log('Class :'+person.class);    //print the class

        Output:
                   { name: 'arave', age: 20 , class:10 }
                   Name : arav
                   Age :  20
                   Class :10
